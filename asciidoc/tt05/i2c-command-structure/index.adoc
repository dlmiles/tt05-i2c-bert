== I2C Command Structure

The I2C protocol uses the first byte from the controller initiated transfer to
provide a target address.  Since the design goal is to test point-to-point
(single controller and single peripheral) context, the address byte is the
device's command byte.  The peripheral in-effect consumes multiple I2C addresses on the
bus for itself.

Command Mnemonic (the commands follow the I2C bit0 write(bit0=0) and
read(bit1=1) state, where a write transaction broadly speaking receives
additional data from the controller, or has a major functional non-idempotent side effect

|===


The DataLen relates to the number of bytes sent or received.

WRITE commands would have the controller sending the data.

READ commands would have the peripheral sending the data.


### ALU Write Operations

The command byte is structured so that:

* bit[7:4] is labelled the `len4` field
* bit[3:2] is the ALU operation
* bit[1] is always set (1)
* bit[0] is always clear (0) as per I2C WRITE operation

A `len12` field is computed from the `REG_LEN` 8-bit register providing the high 8-bits, and the `len4` field from the ALU command providing the lower 4-bits.


### ALU Read Operations

The command byte is structured so that:

* bit[7:4] is labelled the `len4` field
* bit[3:2] is the ALU operation
* bit[1] is always set (1)
* bit[0] is always set (1) as per I2C READ operation

A `len12` field is computed from the `REG_LEN` 8-bit register providing the high 8-bits, and the `len4` field from the ALU command providing the lower 4-bits.


### TT05 edition erratum

The ALU read operations that made it into the TT05 edition were not as planned, due to an error, lack of time to get to testing and updating tech-bench.  So the initial implementation is the version.

These operations do not mutate the accumulator value during each byte of the read operation payload.
