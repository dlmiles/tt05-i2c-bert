== TT05 I2C Command Structure

The I2C protocol uses the first byte from the controller initiated transfer to
provide a target address.  Since the design goal is to test point-to-point
(single controller and single pherpieral) context, the address byte is the
devices command byte.  It in-effect consumes multiple I2C addresses on the
bus for itself.

Command Mnemonic (the commands follow the I2C bit0 write(bit0=0) and
read(bit1=1) state, where a write transaction broadly speaking has a
side-effect.
