== TT05 Project Outline

This is an attempt to provide a hardware project that can quantify the production
process and resulting ICs capability in respect of moderate and low speed
serial communications.

It would be expected to be able to use the results to also quantify operating
capability with asynchronous-serial (such as UART) based on the numbers.



The project does not make provision for achieving better than 1:3 global
clock to I2C clock (SCL) clocking ratios, such as needed for very high-speed
I2C that maybe trying to work nearer the maximum limits of the technology.
